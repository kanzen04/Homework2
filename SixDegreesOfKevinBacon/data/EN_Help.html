        <div style="text-align:left; font-size:14pt; color:#000000">
            <p>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a fun game where one tries to
                connect various actors to Kevin Bacon through the films they've
                been in with other actors. In this edition we'll only use
                actors who have won <a href="https://www.oscars.org/">Academy Awards</a>, either for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor">Best Actor</a>, 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress">Best Actress</a>, 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>,
                or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>.</p>
            
            <p>During gameplay, when a game starts, the player is given a random
            actor and from that individual one must find a path back to Kevin Bacon.
            Note that there is a path for all actors included in the game. One may
            not revisit nodes in the path, so one may not use a Film or Actor more
            than once. The player will be notified of dead ends, like when one 
            chooses a film that doesn't have any other Academy Award-winning actors
            other than the one that brought you there.</p>
